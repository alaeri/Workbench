# Workbench - Kotentin?

This project contains an implementation of *ViewHolderFactory*, a *LifecycleAdapter* and a *LifecycleViewHolder*, it also contains an implementation of a Command Design Pattern.

I began this project as a toyproject to experiment around the CleanArch and hierarchical usecases. 
I also wanted to try the paging library and Koin.
I used the CatsApi to do so.
I realized half-way there that the best way to do it would be to visualize the application execution and that it was worth trying to do it with Kotlin.
I realized half-way there that I was recreating a Command Design Pattern so I tried to implement the pattern
